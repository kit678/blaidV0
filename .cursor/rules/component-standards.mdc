1. All components must:
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for props
   - Follow Radix UI composition patterns
   - Export as named functions
   - Include JSDoc type hints

2. File naming:
   - PascalCase for components
   - .tsx extension
   - colocate tests as Component.test.tsx

@component-template.tsx
