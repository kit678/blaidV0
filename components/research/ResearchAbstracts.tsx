            A Structural Approach to Market Forecasting via Price-Time Geometry
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            This research investigates the hypothesis that financial market movements are governed by an underlying deterministic structure defined by the geometric relationship between price and time. Moving beyond purely statistical or stochastic models, our methodology integrates fixed geometric angle projections, harmonic time cycle analysis derived from natural periodicities, and the principle of price-time squaring to identify potential market turning points and trend trajectories. We present a framework for mapping key support/resistance levels and forecasting volatility shifts based on this intrinsic market architecture. Preliminary findings across various asset classes suggest that this temporal-geometric synthesis offers a distinct and potentially predictive lens for market analysis.
